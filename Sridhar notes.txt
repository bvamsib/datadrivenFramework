there is no resriction on how many variables/ methods/ constructor

We will write classes inside a package. There is no limit on how many classes need to present inside a package.
naming conventions 
---
package - all letters should be in lower case. and if multiple words are present, each word should be sepearted with . (dot)
naming follows revese words order.

search.com.amazon

class
---
Starting character should be uppercase. and if multiple words are present, each word 1st character should be upperCase.

variable/ method (function)
--
camel case format. firstword all chars should be in lower case. If multiple words are present, from 2nd word onwards 1st char should be uppercase.

rateOfInterest - 

1. variable name should not starts with number. we can have numbers in middle of variable name. $ , _
2. spaces are not allowed. if neccesary we will use _ to separate words.
3. there is no limit on no.of characters.
4. we cannot use Java keywords to name any variable. method etc..
5. what ever the names we are giving all should convey actual meaning of that purpose.

invisible parent class - Object

main(
program execution starting point.
After detecting main method, prog execution occur step by step.

public static void main(String[] args)
{

}

we can use logic from one method in other method.

logic build - method declaration only once
method call - method calling ends with ; - any time in mainmethod or any method

Stack memory
--
contains both variable and values, if variable is of primitive dataType.

Heap

1. Primitive DataType - 8 types 
Numbers - 4 types
Decimal numbers - 2 types
true/ flase - 1 type
char - 1 type

byte - 1 byte - 8 bits - 00000000 - 11111111
0-     27+      22+21+20 = 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 = 256 = -128 to +127

short - 2 byte - 16 bits - 65567 = 

variable representation 2 parts
1. variable declaration - dataType with variableName;
2. variable assignment - dataType with variableName = value;

2. Non-Primitive DataType (Reference Variable) - Object

we cannot take non-static content(variable/ method) inside static block
But we can take static content (variable/ method) inside non-static block

static - class level data - is common accross any objects.

(parameters) - while declaring method
(arguments) - passing values to pareameters, at the time of calling method.
